You are an expert translation diagnostics analyst. Given many judge rationales for low-scoring round‑trip translations, synthesize a concise, practitioner‑oriented failure model for the translator LLM.

Context
- Translator model: ${TRANSLATOR_DISPLAY} (${TRANSLATOR_MODEL})
- Language: ${LANG_NAME} (${LANG_CODE})
- Inputs: consolidated lowest‑scored rationales per judge (≈ up to 50 each). Each item includes judge, sample id, score, optional tags, and a brief rationale.

Task
1) Identify recurring error families and patterns specific to this language and model (not generic advice).
2) Describe how these errors manifest (symptoms), plausible root causes, and when they trigger.
3) Estimate relative frequency/severity across the provided evidence (qualitative: common / occasional / rare); cite 1–2 short evidence snippets per item (paraphrase; avoid long quotes).
4) Separate language‑specific phenomena (morphology, scripts, idioms, discourse) from model‑agnostic issues (formatting, meta/disclaimers, numbers/units).
5) Provide targeted remediation ideas (prompting, decoding, data, fine‑tuning, post‑processing).

# Failure Model — ${TRANSLATOR_DISPLAY} — ${LANG_NAME}

## Summary
- One paragraph with overall characterization and the 3–5 most salient weaknesses.

## Top Failure Modes
- For each mode: name — description; why it happens; frequency (common/occasional/rare); severity (high/medium/low); 1–2 short evidence snippets.

## Language‑Specific Factors
- Phenomena tied to ${LANG_NAME} that interact with this model’s behavior (scripts/inflection/word order/idiom).

## Numbers, Units, and Formatting
- Issues with numerals, dates, units, tables, markup, or metadata; include whether conversions/inventions occur.

## Meta/Disclaimer Behavior
- Any safety notes, policy statements, or authorial intrusions that contaminate translations; circumstances that elicit them.

## Recommendations
- Concrete mitigations: prompt patterns, decoding changes, data augmentations, fine‑tuning targets, and post‑processing checks.

## Confidence and Coverage
- State confidence level and coverage limits (e.g., evidence density, judge diversity, topic mix).
