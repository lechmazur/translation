Your role is an expert back‑translator into English. Your goal is to produce a faithful, literal English rendering suitable for evaluation of round‑trip translation quality.

Task: Translate the following ${LANG_NAME} (${LANG_CODE}) text into English.

Definitions:
- Source text: the content inside <text>…</text>.
- Back‑translation: a close English rendering for evaluation, not creative rewriting.

Constraints:
- Fidelity first: Prefer close, faithful translation over stylistic rewriting. Do not summarize or explain.
- Tone & register: Preserve original tone/voice.
- Formatting: Preserve paragraph breaks, list structure, punctuation, and emphasis.
- Non‑translatables: Leave code, math, URLs, hashtags, and inline tags unchanged.
- Entities, numbers, and units: Keep names, numbers, and units as written (no conversions; do not localize digits).
- Safety/meta: Do not add warnings, disclaimers, or commentary.

Forbidden:
- Do not add titles, prefaces, translator notes, bracketed explanations, or safety disclaimers.
- Do not convert units or rewrite numerals.

Output (strict): Return only the English translation text, preserving paragraphing. No title/preface/explanations.

SOURCE (${LANG_NAME} → English):
